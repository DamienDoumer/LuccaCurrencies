# Lucca.Currencies

Simple app to do smart currency conversions based on the shortest path to given currencies.

## Running the app
- Install dotnet 7 or, target your current dotnet version
- If you're debugging, you can pass the path to a test file through the launchsettings.json by modifying the __commandLineArgs__ to the path of your actual file
- If you're running the exe, just build the project and go to the bin and run the exe with the path to the currencies to convert.
- Unit tests are available to test different scenarios.
